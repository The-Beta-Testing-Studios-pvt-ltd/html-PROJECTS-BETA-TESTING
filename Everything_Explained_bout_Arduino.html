                Arduino is an Italian open-source hardware and software company, project, and user community that designs and manufactures single-board 
                microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices. Its hardware products are licensed under a CC BY-SA license, while 
                the software is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) or the GNU General Public License (GPL), permitting the 
                manufacture of Arduino boards and software distribution by anyone. Arduino boards are available commercially from the official website 
                or through authorized distributors.<br><br>

                Arduino board designs use a variety of microprocessors and controllers. The boards are equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output 
                (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards ('shields') or breadboards (for prototyping) and other circuits. The boards 
                feature serial communications interfaces, including Universal Serial Bus (USB) on some models, which are also used for loading programs. 
                The microcontrollers can be programmed using the C and C++ programming languages(Embedded C), using a standard API which is also known as 
                the Arduino Programming Language, inspired by the Processing language and used with a modified version of the Processing IDE. In addition 
                to using traditional compiler toolchains, the Arduino project provides an integrated development environment (IDE) and a command line tool 
                developed in Go.<br><br>

            <h3>
                The Arduino project began in 2005 as a tool for students at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea, Italy, aiming to provide a low-cost and
                easy way for novices and professionals to create devices that interact with their environment using sensors and actuators.
                
                Common examples of such devices intended for beginner hobbyists include simple robots, thermostats, and motion detectors.

                The name Arduino comes from a bar in Ivrea, Italy, where some of the project's founders used to meet. The bar was named after Arduin of Ivrea, 
                who was the margrave of the March of Ivrea and King of Italy from 1002 to 1014.

                <h2>The history of Arduino:</h2><br>

                <h3>
                    The Arduino project was started at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea (IDII) in Ivrea, Italy. At that time, the students used a BASIC 
                    Stamp microcontroller at a cost of $50. In 2003 Hernando Barrag√°n created the development platform Wiring as a Master's thesis project at IDII, 
                    under the supervision of Massimo Banzi and Casey Reas. 
                    
                    Casey Reas is known for co-creating, with Ben Fry, the Processing development platform. 
                    The project goal was to create simple, low cost tools for creating digital projects by non-engineers. The Wiring platform consisted of a printed 
                    circuit board (PCB) with an ATmega128 microcontroller, an IDE based on Processing and library functions to easily program the microcontroller. 

                    In 2005, Massimo Banzi, with David Mellis, another IDII student, and David Cuartielles, extended Wiring by adding support for the cheaper ATmega8 \
                    microcontroller. The new project, forked from Wiring, was called Arduino.
                </h3><br><br>

                <h3>
                    The initial Arduino core team consisted of Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe, Gianluca Martino, and David Mellis.
                    Following the completion of the platform, lighter and less expensive versions were distributed in the open-source community. It was estimated in 
                    mid-2011 that over 300,000 official Arduinos had been commercially produced, and in 2013 that 700,000 official boards were in users' hands
                </h3><br><br>

                <h3>
                    In early 2008, the five co-founders of the Arduino project created a company, Arduino LLC, to hold the trademarks associated with Arduino. 
                    The manufacture and sale of the boards were to be done by external companies, and Arduino LLC would get a royalty from them. The founding bylaws 
                    of Arduino LLC specified that each of the five founders transfer ownership of the Arduino brand to the newly formed company
                </h3><br><br>

                <h3>
                    At the end of 2008, Gianluca Martino's company, Smart Projects, registered the Arduino trademark in Italy and kept this a secret from the other 
                    co-founders for about two years. This was revealed when the Arduino company tried to register the trademark in other areas of the world (they 
                    originally registered only in the US), and discovered that it was already registered in Italy. 
                    
                    Negotiations with Martino and his firm to bring 
                    the trademark under the control of the original Arduino company failed. In 2014, Smart Projects began refusing to pay royalties. They then appointed 
                    a new CEO, Federico Musto, who renamed the company Arduino SRL and created the website arduino.org, copying the graphics and layout of the original 
                    arduino.cc. This resulted in a rift in the Arduino development team. In January 2015, Arduino LLC filed a lawsuit against Arduino SRL.
