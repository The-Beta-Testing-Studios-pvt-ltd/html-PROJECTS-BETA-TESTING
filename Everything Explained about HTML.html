            <h3>
                The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed 
                in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web contents. It is often assisted by technologies 
                such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents 
                from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure
                of a web page semantically for its appearance.<br><br>
                
                HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML, images and other objects such as interactive 
                forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by corresponding structural 
                semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by 
                tags, written using angle brackets.<br><br>

                Tags such as < img > and < input > directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as < p > and < /p > surround 
                and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but 
                use them to interpret the content of the page.

            <h2>What are the advantages of HTML?:</h2><br>

            <h3>
                HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.
                The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML 
                and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997. 
                A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the < canvas > element, together with JavaScript.

                Many tags, particularly the closing tag for the very commonly used paragraph element < p >, are optional. An HTML browser or other 
                agent can infer the closure for the end of an element from the context and the structural rules defined by the HTML standard.

                The text between < html > and < /html > describes the web page, and the text between < body > and < /body > is the visible page content. 
                The markup text < title > ... < /title > defines the browser page title shown on browser tabs and window titles and the tag 
                < div > defines a division of the page used for easy styling. Between < head > and < /head >, a < meta > element can be used to define 
                webpage metadata. The Document Type Declaration < !DOCTYPE html > is for HTML5.

                    Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further 
                    nested elements, as children of the parent element. The start tag may also include the element's attributes within the tag. These 
                    indicate other information, such as identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the 
                    presentation of the document, and for some tags such as the < img > used to embed images, the reference to the image resource in the 
                    format like this: < img src="example.com/example.jpg" >

                    Some elements, such as the line break < br >, or < br > do not permit any embedded content, either text or further tags. These require 
                    only a single empty tag (akin to a start tag) and do not use an end tag. Many tags, particularly the closing end tag for the very commonly 
                    used paragraph element < p >, are optional. An HTML browser or other agent can infer the closure for the end of an element from the context 
                    and the structural rules defined by the HTML standard. These rules are complex and not widely understood by most HTML authors.

                    The general form of an HTML element is therefore: < tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2">''content'' > < /tag >. Some HTML elements are 
                    defined as empty elements and take the form < tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2" >. Empty elements may enclose no content, for instance, 
                    the < br > tag or the inline < img > tag. The name of an HTML element is the name used in the tags. The end tag's name is preceded by a slash 
                    character, /, and that in empty elements the end tag is neither required nor allowed. If attributes are not mentioned, default values are used 
                    in each case.
